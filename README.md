# FreakyBrowse!
This is a browser completly written in Python! We used a lot of guides for the app so keep in mind that we are not THAT smart. 
This gets updates pretty often so make sure to delete the old FreakyBrowse before installing the new version unless you really want it still!

Latest Version: V.1.9

Software supported: Windows

For the homepage of FreakyBrowse, we use https://search.freakybob.site!
